## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights
- **Dataset:** Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset (from Kaggle)
- **ML Model:** Gradient Boosting Regressor with hyperparameter tuning
- **Customer Segmentation:** K-Means clustering on predicted CLTV
- **Explainability:** SHAP values to interpret feature importance
- **APIs:** FastAPI-based endpoint to serve CLTV predictions
- **Dashboard:** Streamlit app to visualize customer segments and predictions
